# Helios - minimalist web framework for Python

Helios is a lightweight Python web routing framework designed to provide a simple way to handle HTTP routing. Built on top of WSGI (Web Server Gateway Interface), it offers a clean and intuitive approach to route requests in your Python web applications.

> **Note:** Helios is a basic routing library designed primarily for learning and experimentation. It is not intended for use in production environments.

## Features

- **WSGI compatibility**: Runs on any WSGI-compatible server such as Gunicorn, uWSGI, or the built-in Python WSGI server.
- **Simple routing**: Define routes easily and map them to Python functions.
- **Dynamic URL parameters**: Extract variables from the URL path.
- **Method support**: Handle different HTTP methods (GET, POST, etc.).
- **Template Support**: Provide basic template rendering support

## Installation

To use Helios in your project, you can install it directly via GitHub or manually by cloning the repository.

### Using Git

```bash
git clone https://github.com/subrotokumar/helios.git
cd helios
pip install .
```

Alternatively, if Helios is hosted on PyPI, you can install it via pip:

```bash
pip install git+https:/github.com/subrotokumar/helios
```

## Usage

### Basic Example

Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to set up Helios with basic routing.

```python
from helios import Helios, Request, Response, HttpStatus
from helios.middlewares import request_logger_middleware
from typing import List
import uuid
from pydantic import BaseModel

class User(BaseModel):
    id: str
    name: str

    def __init__(self, name: str):
        super().__init__(id=str(uuid.uuid4()), name=name)

users: List[User] = [User(name="Subroto")]


app = Helios(middlewares=[request_logger_middleware])

@app.get(path="/health")
def health_check_api(request: Request, response: Response):
    response.send(
        status=HttpStatus.OK,
        body={"message": "Service is healthy"}
    )

@app.get(path="/users")
def list_users(request: Request, response: Response):
    response.send(
        status=HttpStatus.OK,
        body=[user.__dict__ for user in users]
    )

@app.post(path="/users")
def add_user(request: Request, response: Response):
    print(f"body {request.body}")
    print(type(request.body))
    new_user = User(name=request.body["name"])
    users.append(new_user)
    response.send(
        status=HttpStatus.CREATED,
        body=new_user.__dict__
    )
```

### Running the App with a WSGI Server

Helios is designed to run on any WSGI-compatible server. For example, using Gunicorn:

1. Save your application in a file (e.g., `main.py`).
2. Run the application with Gunicorn:

```bash
gunicorn main:app
```

In the above example, `app` refers to the Helios application instance, and `main.py` is the Python file containing your app.

## Supported HTTP Methods

Helios currently supports the following HTTP methods:

- `GET`
- `POST`
- `PUT`
- `DELETE`

You can specify the methods for each route using the `methods` argument in the route decorator.

## Limitations

- **Not production-ready**: Helios is intended for educational and learning purposes. It is not optimized for high performance or scalability.
- **Minimal functionality**: This library provides basic routing and HTTP request handling but lacks advanced features such as middleware support, templating, and database integration.
- **No built-in templating**: Helios does not include a templating engine as of right now. [**Comming Soon**]

## Contributing

Helios is open-source and welcomes contributions! If you find any bugs or want to improve the library, feel free to fork the repository and submit a pull request.
